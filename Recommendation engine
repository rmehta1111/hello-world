#To check implicit or explicit features, we can use:
df[['feature1','feature2','feature3']].nunique()

#Tip: The one with lesser number of values is implicit. For example a binary feature is just a flag

#Non-personalized recommendations- Common recommendations to everyone
#For example for a movie recommendation- we can use value_counts and index to get the most rented/watched movie

df['movie_name'].value_counts().index
